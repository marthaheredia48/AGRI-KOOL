# Agri-Kool: NASA Space Apps Challenge Hackathon 2024 Final Project

## Project Overview
Agri-Kool is our team's innovative solution developed during the NASA Space Apps Challenge 2024. It addresses climate challenges faced by smallholder farmers in Puebla, Mexico, by providing easy access to NASA data on precipitation and soil moisture, along with crop recommendations. Our app helps farmers make better agricultural decisions, improving productivity and sustainability.

## Team Contributions
- **Angelica Canto**: Programmed the map, documented the process, and described the final project.
- **Juan Pablo Lopez**: Developed the precipitation and soil moisture analysis, designed the front end, and integrated the features.
- **Martha Heredia**: Led the data analysis using NASA datasets in Python, created the user registration, notification system, WhatsApp community, progress tracking, and the monthly reporting features.
- **Ximena Tovar**: Managed the project presentation, created the video, and co-programmed the map.

## Project Highlights
1. **Interactive Mapping Tools**: Visualizes real-time and historical precipitation and soil moisture data.
2. **Crop Recommendations**: Matches soil conditions with ideal crops to maximize yield.
3. **Performance Tracking**: Tracks farmers' water usage and crop yield, offering medals and progress reports.
4. **Community Building**: Provides a platform for farmers to connect, share insights, and improve irrigation practices.

## Technologies Used
- **Swift/SwiftUI**: Used for front-end development on Xcode.
- **Python**: For NASA data analysis and model implementation.
- **NASA Data**: Integrated precipitation and soil moisture data.
- **Canva & Flippaclip**: For creating the projectâ€™s visual content.

## Goals
Our vision is to help farmers combat climate variability and ensure long-term sustainability in agriculture, starting in Puebla but with the aim to expand globally.
